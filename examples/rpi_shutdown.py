"""rpi_shutdown.py - Sample script to shut down the Raspberry Pi Compute Module when the Shutdown Signal
from the NEC display goes low - signalling that power is about to be shut off.
Copy this file to a suitable location such as "â€œ/usr/share/NEC/".
Run this script each time the system starts.

For example it can be added to the "/etc/rc.local" file. Add the following line to the "/etc/rc.local"
file before the line with the text "exit 0":
sudo python /usr/share/NEC/rpi_shutdown.py &

[Modify the above path according to the location where this file is stored]
